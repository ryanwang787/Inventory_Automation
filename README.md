# Inventory_Automation
Automation of excel spreadsheet keyword search and sort for inventories.

This project was to automate a keyword search and sort for various inventories. 
For inventories that already had a centralized master sheet, it performed the keyword search on that spreadsheet and sorted the items that had a hit accordingly.
For inventories that did not have a centralized master sheet, it scraped the website HTML for this information and wrote it to a new spreadsheet, then keyword searched it.
